theprepared.org is a community, spanning one-to-many and many-to-many digital communication - and the occasional in-person event. Each of these is dedicated to providing a harassment-free  experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Slack and other online media. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled without a refund at the discretion of the organizers.

All discussions of proprietary info at theprepared.org (including on Slack and in-person events) are by default off the record. All participants in theprepared.orgâ€™s various communication channels agree to abide by [the FriendDA](https://friendda.org/) unless an alternate arrangement is explicitly and formally agreed to. If you overhear something that tickles your interest and might be construed to be private, you should contact the speaker directly and get explicit confirmation from them before adapting, disseminating, or promoting it on their behalf.
